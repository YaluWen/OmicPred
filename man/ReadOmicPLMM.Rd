\title{Multi-kernel linear mixed model with adaptive lasso for prediction analysis on high-dimensional multi-omics data}
\usage{
ReadOmicPLMM(OmicsData = list(), OmicsDataMap = list(), trainID,
  OmicsKernelMatrix = list(), annotation = NULL, Y, X = NULL,
  kernelsOmics = NA, AllRegions = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{OmicsData}{A list with each element representing data from one omic. Each row represents an observation, and each column represents a predictor.}

\item{OmicsDataMap}{A list with each element representing annotation for one omic. Each row is a predictor. Each row should have at least 2 columns ("chromosome","position"). The number of rows should be the same as the number of columns in the corresponding omic data.}

\item{trainID}{Subject ID for the training individuals.}

\item{OmicsKernelMatrix}{A list with each element represents similarity matrices for each omic data. If provided, will ignore the inputs from \code{OmicsData} and \code{OmicsDataMap}.}

\item{annotation}{A data frame providing information to cut the genome. It has at least four columns: gene, chr, start, end. The gene column must be unique. The other three columns contain information about chromosome, start and end of each genomic region. If Kinship is not provided, then annotation must be provided.}

\item{Y}{A vector of phenotypes with each name being subject ID.}

\item{X}{A matrix of demographic variables, should be of the same order as Y (i.e. \code{rownames(X)=names(Y)}). The intercept column is not needed.}

\item{kernelsOmics}{kernels used for other omic data. Currently, it uses linear kernel for non-genomic data. For genomic data, it can take linear and IBS kernels.  Its length should be the same as the number of omic data if provided.}

\item{AllRegion}{A bool to indicate whether genomic similarity matrix should be calculated from the entire genome. Default=0.}
}
\value{
A list that contains a vector of outcome (i.e. \code{Y}), a list named \code{KernelOutput} that contains the similarity (i.e. \code{KernelOutput$Kinship}) and region included (i.e. \code{KernelOutput$IncludeRegions}) for each omic and a vector of IDs of training data (i.e. \code{trainID}). All of these are needed for OmicsPLMMPred algorithm (i.e. the function \code{OmicsPLMMPred}).
